function [jumps] = getRelativeJumps(tJ, t0, tL)
%getJumpsFromTable creates a jump vector [seconds] since time series
% start (t0)
%   t: datetime vector with jumps for *current* station
%   t0: first observation in time series as a datetime
%   tL: last observation in time series as a datetime
% subtract time first TS observation to get relative times [seconds]
jumps0 = etime(datevec(tJ), ... % before = negative

% remove negative values -> jumps AFTER Time Series ends

% sort jumps
